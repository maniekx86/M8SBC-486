Special thanks to PCBWay for sponsoring PCBs for this project! Their sponsorship was a huge help and enabled me to make progress with this project. PCBWay is a well-known PCB prototyping and manufacturing service, providing high-quality boards and excellent customer support. I have worked with their boards in the past and can say that they are of great quality. I easily placed an order for PCBs on their platform for this project without any problems. The sponsorship also included a free quick delivery option. If youâ€™re looking for reliable PCB prototyping and manufacturing services, I highly recommend [checking them](https://www.pcbway.com).
